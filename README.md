### Animated Static Web Pages

Made with css html and js (only works on pc) and a little bit of â†’_â†’ [love ðŸ’Œ](https://xuezzou.github.io/for-him/)

#### Thanks to these resources (à¹‘Â¯â—¡Â¯à¹‘)

#### Run
Could `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to [localhost:8000] to avoid CORS error. Since the github page works a little differently, need to change the font directory path to `../fonts/[name]` instead of `../../for-him/fonts/ if running on python local server.

#### Good morning good afternoon good evening goodnight
- Should make as a simple page application, adjust mobile view and add more transitions.
